# Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are impressive, but their knowledge is limited to what they were trained on. By building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, you can expand their knowledge with your own data, enabling LLMs to provide more accurate, personalized responses tailored to your specific domain.

GraphRAG takes RAG a step further by combining the strengths of knowledge graphs with LLMs, creating a system that leverages structured relationships for reasoning, insights, and efficient retrieval.

# Knowledge graphs and RAG
Knowledge graphs provide a structured representation of entities and their relationships, enabling more intelligent data retrieval and reasoning compared to flat, vector-based systems. Here’s why they’re game-changing for RAG:

Relational context - Graphs encode semantic relationships, offering richer insights than traditional data structures.
Improved retrieval accuracy - Graph-specific retrieval techniques like community detection and impact analysis provide precise, relevant results.
Multi-hop reasoning - Traverse connected data neighborhoods to uncover complex relationships.
Efficient information navigation - Analyze focused subgraphs instead of entire datasets.
Dynamically Evolving Knowledge - Real-time graph updates ensure your knowledge graph stays current and actionable.

GraphRAG enables developers to:

Structure and model data. Organize entities and relationships into a graph that supports both reasoning and retrieval.
Retrieve relevant information. Use graph-based strategies to extract data for LLM queries.
Enable real-time performance. Dynamically update knowledge graphs in production to reflect new information.
Enhance AI applications. Provide LLMs with context-rich, precise data for better answers and recommendations.
A GraphRAG application running in production needs to balance scalability, performance, and adaptability. Memgraph’s in-memory graph database provides:

Real-time performance. Handle dynamic queries and updates with minimal latency.
Scalability. Manage large datasets and complex queries without bottlenecks.
Durability. Ensure data persistence for backup, recovery, and long-term analysis.

# Key features for GraphRAG
Memgraph equips you with a powerful set of tools and algorithms that make building a GraphRAG efficient and scalable. Here’s how each feature plays a role in enhancing your Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows:

Vector search: A pivotal first step for extracting relevant information during pivot search. Vector search allows you to perform semantic searches, matching context or meaning rather than exact terms.
Deep-path traversals: Enables rapid navigation through complex relationships in your graph, supporting multi-hop queries and reasoning across interconnected data.
Leiden community detection: A faster, more accurate algorithm than Louvain, Leiden ensures well-connected communities, making it ideal for relevance expansion in retrieval processes.
Louvain and dynamic community detection: Louvain is a foundational clustering algorithm for discovering communities, while dynamic community detection adapts in real time, accommodating graph updates without compromising cluster integrity.
PageRank and dynamic PageRank: PageRank ranks nodes based on their influence or importance. Its dynamic counterpart adjusts these rankings as new data is ingested, ensuring retrieval results remain relevant.
Text search: Facilitates keyword-based searches, allowing you to locate specific entities or relationships within your graph quickly. This complements vector search for hybrid retrieval strategies.
Geospatial search: Geospatial search enables you to integrate and retrieve location-based insights, enhancing the relevance and precision of responses.
Run-time schema tracking: Tracks schema changes as they happen, enabling seamless updates and adaptations in your graph structure without manual intervention. This is especially useful if you’re including schema into the LLM context.
Real-time data ingestion - Memgraph supports seamless integration with streaming platforms like Kafka, Redpanda, and Pulsar, allowing you to continuously grow and update your knowledge graph. Combine this with Memgraph MAGE or custom procedures to dynamically query and analyze incoming data.
